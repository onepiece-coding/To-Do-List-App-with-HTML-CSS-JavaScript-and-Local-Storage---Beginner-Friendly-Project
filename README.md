## Code Overview

### HTML

The structure of the application is defined in index.html. The main components include:

- A form for task input, including a text field, category dropdown, and buttons for adding and editing tasks.
  
- A section to display tasks with filtering options.
  
### CSS

All styling is contained within style.css, providing a clean and modern design for the to-do list app. Styles are responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

### JavaScript

The core functionality is managed in script.js:

- Adding/Editing/Deleting Tasks: Handles all task management functions.
  
- Local Storage: Saves tasks in the browser's local storage so they persist after page reloads.
  
- Filtering: Allows filtering by category tabs.
  
## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For the basic structure and layout of the app.

- CSS3: For styling the app with responsive design principles.

- JavaScript (ES6): For functionality and interactivity.

- Local Storage: To save tasks data within the browser.
